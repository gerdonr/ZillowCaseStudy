# Zillow Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Zillow is the leading online real estate marketplace and database company in the United States, listing over 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent, and homes not currently on the market while also drawing 173 million unique visitors to its website each month. Since being founded in Seattle in 2006, Zillow has expanded and grown tremendously. Founders Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink, former executives of Microsoft and founders of Expedia, Spencer Rascoff, a Hotwire.com cofounder, David Beitel, and Kristin Acker have always had a grand vision for how Zillow could transform the real estate landscape with the help of technology. 
 
Rich Barton was inspired to create Zillow after working at Microsoft and realizing all of the ways that changes in data science and access to computers would affect different industries, particularly with real estate. 

## Business Activities

Within the first few months of being founded, Zillow was able to receive over $57 billion in funding from several big investors. Originally, Zillow’s main source of revenue was from selling advertisements on its website to real estate, rental, and mortgage companies, but the company has expanded to become the top online real estate marketplace in the U.S. While most known for being a database for homes that users can browse and filter through using specifications such as price, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location, Zillow now also gives users the ability to buy and sell homes, list and manage properties, learn about real estate, and even receive mortgage financing all from the Zillow website. 
 
Since launching in 2018, one of the biggest revenue generators for Zillow currently is Zillow Offers, an on-demand home-buying service that gives homeowners the ability to buy and sell their homes directly with Zillow. Homeowners can sell directly to Zillow for a cash offer on their own timeline and with reduced seller fees. Zillow can then have a local team make any necessary repairs or updates and then resell the property via a local Zillow agent. Getting involved in the market for real estate transactions has allowed for a lot more opportunity for Zillow. For instance, in 2019 Zillow recorded $2.74 billion in revenue, a huge jump from $1.18 billion in 2018. Buying and selling homes accounted for close to 50% of the sales up from 3.9% the prior year. 
 
Zillow is also involved in rental real estate and provides an easy way for people to search, tour, apply, and pay rent for those who want to rent a property while allowing landlords and property managers to more easily list their rentals and manage properties.
 
The capitalization of technology has been the driving factor leading Zillow to disrupt the real estate landscape over time. The technology that Zillow is most known for is its Zestimate, the algorithm Zillow uses to predict home and rental values for millions of homes. The Zestimate uses machine learning algorithms that take into account factors such as special home features, commute times, and proximity to nearby parks, freeways, or schools to predict the selling price or rental rate for a home as accurately as possible. In 2017, Zillow held a 2 year data science competition called Zillow Prize to generate ideas to improve the Zestimate, which now has a median error rate of less than 2%. Currently the Zillow team is working to be able to provide home buyers with an accurate future home value. This information would be a boon to investors and home buyers alike. 
 
Another use of technology to further its advancement is Zillow’s processing of clickstream data. Everytime someone creates a profile, starts a search, clicks a link, or does anything on the Zillow website, clickstream data is generated. Creating systems to collect, parse, and process this data has allowed Zillow to gain insight to make more personalized recommendations for users as well as to answer important business questions for Zillow.
 
Zillow’s mobile app is a use of technology that literally puts tons of real estate information in users' fingertips. Along with the features the website offers, the mobile app also gives users the ability to take 3D home tours and search for homes based on current location or a specified set of criteria. 

## Landscape

Technological changes to the real estate landscape over the last decade have had a huge impact on the way people buy and sell homes and Zillow is not the only company making competitive strides. Other big players in the online real estate game include Redfin, HomeSnap, NeighborhoodScout, and Realtor.com. Trulia is also a major company in the real estate domain but was actually acquired by Zillow in 2015. 
 
While Redfin and HomeSnap offer some similarities to Zillow including a homesearch feature, they have a couple of unique qualities that set them apart. Redfin has real estate agents whose compensation is directly related to the ratings they receive online. Redfin also offers a rebate to homebuyers for a portion of the real estate commission. What sets HomeSnap apart is their mobile app. One such feature of the app is that users can take a real time photo of a house that is for sale and be instantly prompted with all the required listing information about the house. 
 
NeighborhoodScout differs from Zillow in that it provides more information specific to neighborhoods such as crime reports, traffic data, school information, and demographics.

## Results

Zillow has absolutely disrupted the real estate market since its inception in 2006. As a self-described “real estate marketplace”, Zillow has grown from a media and information company simply offering advertising to brokers and agents to a now multi-faceted company that buys and sells homes directly, provides mortgage lending services, offers tenant-management tools, and boasts a huge home database with information on billions of homes.
 
Since shifting its focus to buying and selling homes directly, Zillow is projected to see a huge increase in revenue in the next few years. To put things into perspective, in 2018 Zillow brought in $1.8 billion total but is projecting to generate over $20 billion in the next few years from home sales alone.
 
Redfin has also recently introduced direct home buying and selling into their business model, a division that brought in $21 million in revenue in the last quarter, which made up over 20% of the total revenue during that time. Despite the competition from Redfin, Zillow is the bigger company with a market cap of $8.6 billion and revenue of $1.6 billion compared to Redfin, which has a market cap of $1.6 billion and revenue of $487 million

## Recommendations

One area that Zillow could expand upon is services for landlords and property managers. There are currently smaller companies that cater more toward rental real estate and this is definitely an area that Zillow could expand into. This would also open up Zillow to another demographic of people: investors and property managers. 
 
Currently landlords and property managers can use Zillow to market a rental property and collect rent but there are many other offerings that could be beneficial. One example would be a way to handle maintenance requests and to coordinate repair work with local contractors. This could be done by allowing the tenant and the landlord to more easily communicate or even use machine learning to create a smart assistant to take more work off of the landlord. If the tenant could use the Zillow app to let the landlord or smart assistant know about a maintenance issue, the landlord or smart assistant could then connect with a repairman in the area and coordinate a time and a price for the job. 
 
This addition to the Zillow domain is totally within the realm of possibility for Zillow. The company already has an app and already has the technology in place to make this happen. The hardest part would probably be the machine learning to create a smart assistant to help with answering questions and handling maintenance requests. A great feature would be a digital assistant to prompt the tenant with questions to gather the needed information to handle repairs or to answer basic questions.
 
Overall, Zillow is positioned to continue to be the top online real estate marketplace in the U.S. They continue to expand to handle more needs and desires of people in all aspects of real estate. It is an exciting time for the real estate market and it will be interesting to see how Zillow continues to evolve over the coming years.
